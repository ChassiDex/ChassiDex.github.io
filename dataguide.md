## 1. General Information

### 1.1 Species name
Organisms on ChassiDex are stored species-wise. The genus name and specific epithet are required to store the organism. Different strains/variants of the organisms need not be represented here.

### 1.2 Safety
The safety level (BSL 1-4) helps researchers decide if their lab is equipped enough to safely handle the organism. This also determines various use-cases for the organism.

### 1.3 Tags
Tags are usually one-phrase descriptions that help group organisms and provide a very brief description. While filling in data, select all relevant tags from the already used ones and add new tags if possible.

### 1.4 Applications
Briefly mention all uses and potential applications this organism could have, using synthetic biology.
