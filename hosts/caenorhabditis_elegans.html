    <h1>The Worm</h1>
<p>Common Name : The Worm</p>
<p>Scientific Name : Caenorhabditis elegans</p>
<p>Multicellular eukaryotic nematode</p>
<p>Biosafety Level: BSL1</p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>As a model organism, C. elegans is a species of nematode worm, and the adults are<br>
approximately 1 mm in length with 959 somatic cells. Its transparent body consists of<br>
three layers; an epidermal layer, an intestinal layer, and a muscle layer.Other systems<br>
such as the nervous system and reproductive systems are found between the three<br>
layers.There are physiological overlaps between humans and C. elegans, such as the<br>
digestive system, the nervous system, and the reproductive system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Size and transparency allows for easy anatomy and developmental examination under a<br>
microscope.</p>
</li>
<li>C. elegans has a much simpler anatomy than humans (it doesn’t have bones, a heart or<br>
a circulatory system) but it does share many genes and molecular pathways with<br>
us.Many of the genes in the C. elegans genome have functional counterparts in humans<br>
which makes it an extremely useful model for human diseases.</li>
<li>Easy maintenance, short lifespan and easy breeding makes C.elegans a good model<br>
organism.</li>
<li>The lifespan of C. elegans is 2-3 weeks. Developing from eggs, an individual goes<br>
through four larval stages before reaching maturity. Short lifespan helps study disease<br>
progression.</li>
<li>C. elegans display two sexes; male or hermaphrodite. The hermaphrodites are able to<br>
self-fertilize and can give birth to hundreds of progeny.This ability to self-fertilize is a<br>
useful tool for its use as a model organism, not only because these hermaphrodites can<br>
reproduce in high numbers quickly, but also because certain mutated strains of C.<br>
elegans may be paralyzed but do not need to find a mate to reproduce.</li>
<li>Healthy cultures of C. elegans can be frozen and then defrosted and revived when<br>
needed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<ul>
<li>C. elegans as a model organism has advantages including having all the physiological<br>
properties of an animal, the ability to replicate human diseases and a fast life cycle. C.<br>
elegans has been used as a model organism to study human diseases ranging from<br>
Parkinson’s disease to mitochondrial diseases, as well as studying the immune system.</li>
<li>C. elegans mutants can be screened with thousands of potential drugs for important<br>
diseases.</li>
<li>Studying cell death or ‘apoptosis’ in the C. elegans could hold the key to counteracting<br>
the effects of aging in humans as well as providing clues about cancer, diabetes and<br>
other diseases. It is found that human genes responsible for a range of mitochondrial<br>
diseases have orthologous genes in C. elegans. Hence, C. elegans is a possible model<br>
organism for the study of mitochondrial diseases.</li>
<li>C. elegans only has innate immunity and is devoid of adaptive immunity. Hence it is used<br>
as a model organism to study the innate immune response to pathogens.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Maintenance</h2>
<p>C. elegans is maintained in the laboratory on Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) agar which has<br>
been aseptically poured into petri plates (Brenner, 1974).<br>
Several sizes of petri plates are available and can be purchased from companies such as Nunc<br>
or Falcon. Smaller plates (35 mm diameter) are useful for matings or when using expensive<br>
drugs. Medium size plates (60 mm diameter) are useful for general strain maintenance, and<br>
larger plates (100 mm diameter) are useful for growing larger quantities of worms, such as for<br>
certain mutant screens.</p>
<h3>Preparation of NGM plates -</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Mix 3 g NaCl, 17 g agar, and 2.5 g peptone in a 2 liter Erlenmeyer flask. Add 975 ml<br>
H2O.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cover the mouth of the flask with aluminum foil. Autoclave for 50 min. Cool flask in 55°C<br>
water bath for 15 min. Add 1 ml 1 M CaCl2, 1 ml 5 mg/ml cholesterol in ethanol, 1 ml 1 M<br>
MgSO4 and 25 ml 1 M KPO4 buffer. Swirl to mix well.</p>
</li>
<li>Using sterile procedures, dispense the NGM solution into petri plates using a peristaltic<br>
pump. Fill plates 2/3 full of agar.</li>
<li>Leave plates at room temperature for 2-3 days before use to allow for detection of<br>
contaminants, and to allow excess moisture to evaporate.</li>
<li>Plates stored in an air-tight container at room temperature will be usable for several<br>
weeks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Seeding NGM plates -</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Using sterile technique, apply approximately 0.05 ml of E. coli OP50 liquid culture to<br>
small or medium NGM plates or 0.1 ml to large NGM plates using a pipet.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If desired, the drop can be spread using the pipet tip or a glass rod. Spreading will create<br>
a larger lawn, which can aid in visualizing the worms. Take care not to spread the lawn<br>
all the way to the edges of the plate; keep the lawn in the center.</p>
</li>
<li>The worms tend to spend most of the time in the bacteria. If the lawn extends to the<br>
edges of the plate the worms may crawl up the sides of the plate, dry out and die.</li>
<li>Allow the E. coli OP50 lawn to grow overnight at room temperature or at 37°C for 8<br>
hours</li>
</ul>
<h3>C. elegans visualization -</h3>
<ul>
<li>C. elegans is transparent and can be visualized using a dissecting stereo microscope<br>
equipped with a transmitted light source.</li>
<li>The CGC uses Wild Leitz model M5A or Zeiss model SV6. Standard 10X eyepieces and<br>
objectives which range from 0.6X to 5X (total magnification of 6X to 50X) are widely<br>
used.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Transferring C. elegans from one plate to another -</h3>
<h4>Chunking -</h4>
<ul>
<li>A sterilized scalpel or spatula is used to move a chunk of agar from an old plate to a<br>
fresh plate. There will usually be hundreds of worms in the chunk of agar.</li>
<li><p>The worms will crawl out of the chunk and spread out onto the bacterial lawn of the new<br>
plate.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This method works well for transferring worms that have burrowed into the agar or are<br>
difficult to pick individually.</p>
</li>
<li>The chunking method is fine for transferring homozygous stocks but it is not advisable if<br>
the population is heterozygous or if a stock must be maintained by mating.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Single animal transfer by worm picker-</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>A worm picker can be made by mounting a 1-inch piece of 32 gauge platinum wire into<br>
either the tip of a pasteur pipet or in a bacteriological loop holder.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Platinum wire heats and cools quickly and can be flamed often (between transfers) to<br>
avoid contaminating the worm stocks.</p>
</li>
<li>The end of the wire, used for picking up worms, can be flattened slightly with a hammer<br>
and then filled with an emery cloth to remove sharp edges; sharp points can poke holes<br>
in the worms and kill them or make holes in the agar.</li>
<li>The tip of the wire can be fashioned to your liking. Some people prefer a flattened end,<br>
while others prefer a slight bend that forms a hook. It takes a bit of experience with a<br>
worm picker to avoid poking holes in the agar. Worms crawl into the holes, making it<br>
difficult to see or pick them.</li>
<li>General stock maintenance tips C. elegans stocks can best be maintained between<br>
16°C and 25°C, most typically at 20°C. C. elegans grows 2.1 times faster at 25°C than at<br>
16°C, and 1.3 times faster at 20°C than at 16°C. This variation in growth periods can be<br>
useful when planning experiments.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Growth of C. elegans in liquid medium-</h3>
<ul>
<li>Large quantities of C. elegans can be grown in liquid medium. Liquid cultures of C.<br>
elegans are usually grown on S Medium using concentrated E. coli OP50 as a food<br>
source (Lewis and Fleming, 1995). It is often best to grow just one generation of worms<br>
in liquid before the worms are harvested.</li>
<li>When growing worms for more than one generation, overcrowding can often lead to<br>
dauer formation despite the presence of food.</li>
<li>Overnight cultures of E. coli OP50 grown in LB or other rich broth medium should be<br>
used to make a concentrated pellet of bacteria.</li>
<li>The concentrated pellet can be stored at 4°C for several weeks or in a -70°C freezer<br>
indefinitely.</li>
<li>It is a good idea to have a large amount of concentrated E. coli OP50 available so that<br>
food can be added as needed.</li>
<li>The amount of food needed will depend on the starting inoculum of worms and the<br>
length of time the worms are grown.</li>
<li>As a point of reference, you can grow a 250 ml batch of liquid culture by inoculating with<br>
worms recovered from 4 large (100 mm) petri plates and growing for 4-5 days.</li>
<li>Initially, packed E. coli OP50 from a 2 liter culture is provided. The worm culture is<br>
monitored, and additional E. coli OP50 is added as needed.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Methods-</h4>
<ol>
<li>Add 250 ml S Medium to a sterilized 1-2 liter flask. Inoculate the S Medium with a<br>
concentrated E. coli OP50 pellet made from 2-3 liters of an overnight culture.</li>
<li>Wash each of 4 large plates of C. elegans (just cleared of bacteria) with 5 ml S Medium<br>
and add to the 250 ml flask.</li>
<li>Put the flask on a shaker at 20°C. Use fairly vigorous shaking so that the culture is well<br>
oxygenated.</li>
<li>Cultures should be monitored by checking a drop of the culture under the microscope. If<br>
the food supply is depleted (the solution is no longer visibly cloudy) add more<br>
concentrated E. coli OP50 suspended in S Medium.</li>
<li>When there are many adult animals in each drop, the culture is ready to be harvested.<br>
This is usually on the 4th or 5th day.</li>
<li>Put the flask on ice for 15 minutes to allow the worms to settle. Aspirate most of the<br>
liquid from the flask.</li>
<li>Transfer the remaining liquid to a 50 ml sterile conical centrifuge tube and spin for at<br>
least 2 min at 1150 × g to pellet the worms. Young larvae may take longer than 2 min to<br>
pellet.</li>
<li>Aspirate the remaining liquid.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Freezing and recovery of C. elegans stocks -</h3>
<p>Caenorhabditis elegans can be frozen and stored indefinitely in liquid nitrogen (−196 °C)<br>
(Brenner, 1974). The keys to a successful freeze are using animals at the correct stage of<br>
development, the addition of glycerol to the freezing media, and a gradual cooling to -80°C.<br>
Freshly starved young larvae (L1-L2 stage) survive freezing best. Well-fed animals, adults, eggs<br>
and dauers do not survive well. It is best to use several plates of worms that have just<br>
exhausted the E. coli OP50 lawn and that contain lots of L1-L2 animals. A 15% final volume of<br>
glycerol in the freezing solution is used. A 1°C decrease in temperature per minute is desirable<br>
during freezing.<br>
This can be achieved by placing the worms (in freezer vials) in a styrofoam container at -80°C.<br>
The styrofoam container can be either a commercial shipping box (with walls at least ¾ inch<br>
thick) or a small styrofoam box with slots for holding vials. After 12 or more hours at -80°C, the<br>
freezer vials should be transferred to their permanent freezer location for long term storage.</p>
<h4>Freezing C. elegans using Liquid Freezing Solution Methods -</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use one large, 2-3 medium, or 5-6 small NGM plates that have lots of freshly starved<br>
L1-L2 animals. Wash the plates with 0.6 ml S Buffer for each vial you will freeze. Collect<br>
liquid in a sterile test tube.</li>
<li>Add an equal volume of S Buffer + 30% glycerin. Mix well.</li>
<li>Aliquot 1.0 ml of mixture into 1.8 ml cryovials labeled with strain name and date.</li>
<li>Pack the cryovials in a small styrofoam box with slots for holding microtubes or use a<br>
commercial styrofoam shipping box.</li>
<li>Place the box in a −80°C freezer overnight (or for at least 12 hours).</li>
<li>The next day transfer the vials to their permanent freezer locations.</li>
<li>Thaw one vial as a tester to check how well the worms survived the freezing.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Thawing C. elegans frozen using Liquid Freezing Solution Methods-</h4>
<ul>
<li>Melt Soft Agar Freezing Solution in an autoclave or microwave and place in a 50°C<br>
water bath for at least 15 minutes.</li>

<li>The next day transfer the vials to their permanent freezer locations. Take a scoop of<br>
frozen mixture from one vial as a tester to check how well the worms survived the<br>
freezing (see Protocol 10).</li>
</ul>

<li>Thawing C. elegans frozen using Soft Agar Freezing Solution Methods Remove a vial<br>
from −80°C freezer and transfer to a small styrofoam box with slots for microtubes. Work<br>
quickly so that the solution in the vial does not thaw.</li>
<li>Flame a small scoop or spatula and use it to remove 1/4 - 1/3 ml of the frozen solution.<br>
Place solution on a NGM plate with E. coli OP50 lawn. Return vial to −80°C freezer as<br>
quickly as possible.</li>
<li>You should see worms wiggling after just a few minutes. After 2-3 days, transfer 10-15<br>
animals individually to separate plates.</li>
<li>Allow the animals to reproduce for one generation and score the progeny for correct<br>
phenotypes</li>
