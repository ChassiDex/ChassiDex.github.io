    <h1>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</h1>
<p>Scientific Name : Agrobacterium tumefaciens</p>
<p>Prokaryotic Gram Negative Bacterium</p>
<p>Biosafety Level: BSL1</p>
<h2>Benefits and applications</h2>
<p>Agrobacterium is a soil phytopathogen that infects plant wound and causes Crown Gall disease<br>
by horizontal gene transfer(Transferred T-DNA plasmid) through bacterial type IV secretory<br>
system. This manifests as a tumor like outgrowth. The ability of plasmid transfer by<br>
Agrobacterium is harnessed as a tool for transformation of plants for the purpose of genetic<br>
modification. Over the years agrobacterium mediated gene transfer has become a well<br>
accepted method that yields high results.<br>
Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer is a strong tool for producing secondary metabolites and<br>
recombinant proteins (namely, molecular farming), phytoremediation and pharmaceuticals, crop</p>
<p>improvement, targeted gene knockdown, and the development of biotic and abiotic resistant<br>
transgenic plants.</p>
<h2>Maintenance</h2>
<h3>Short-term storage</h3>
<p>For short-term storage of Agrobacterium, cells can be kept on agar media and stored at 4°C for<br>
several weeks.</p>
<h3>Long-term storage</h3>
<p>The ideal way to store Agrobacterium strains, ensuring that genetic changes due to laboratory<br>
selection are limited, is to keep them frozen at −80°C in 30% glycerol</p>
<h3>Growth conditions</h3>
<ul>
<li>A. tumefaciens grows optimally at 28°C. The doubling time can range from 2.5–4 h<br>
depending on the media, culture format and level of aeration.</li>
<li>LB is a common laboratory medium used to support growth of A. tumefaciens. This<br>
minimal medium provides a non-stressful environment with all essential nutrients and<br>
limits the development of auxotrophic mutants. LB medium is the standard growth<br>
medium and will allow for a doubling time ranging from 2.5h 4h (dependent on specific<br>
carbon/nitrogen sources and antibiotics) and will approach stationary phase at an<br>
OD600 of 0.9.</li>
<li>Induction Broth (IB medium) is thought to mimic aspects of the vir-inducing conditions of<br>
a plant wound. In this medium, Ti plasmid bearing cells grow markedly slower with a<br>
lower yield (due to the high cost of vir gene expression and phosphorus limitation) and<br>
will reach stationary phase at an OD600 of approximately 0.2–0.4. In shaken liquid<br>
cultures, clumps of cells can be easily visualized in the medium. It has been observed<br>
that even in very light cultures that appear clear, there are high numbers of cells likely<br>
attributable to this clumping and perhaps smaller cell size.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Agrobacterium Competent Cell Preparation</h3>
<ol>
<li>From a frozen glycerol stock grow a 20 ml culture of Agrobacterium overnight at room<br>
temperature</li>
<li>The following morning dilute the culture by adding 0.5 μl of culture to 2 ml of H2O making a<br>
4000 fold dilution. From the 4000 fold dilution take 0.5 μl and add to 2 ml H2O making a 16,000<br>
fold dilution, from the 16,000 fold dilution take 0.5 μl and add to 2 ml H2O making a 64,000 fold<br>
dilution</li>
<li>Add 5 μl of the 64,000 fold dilution to an LB plate and thoroughly spread the culture on the<br>
plate, incubate at room temp or 28°C for 1 - 3 days<br>
26</li>
<li>Once you have single colonies on a plate, pick a colony and start a 20 ml overnight culture in<br>
LB at 27°C .</li>
<li>Inoculate two 500 ml flasks (use 1 liter flasks) of LB with 9 ml of the overnight culture, do not<br>
use antibiotics here.</li>
<li>Grow cells to an OD600 nm of 0.5 - 1</li>
<li>Precool Centrifuge to 4°C</li>
<li>When cells are ready to harvest chill flasks on ice for 15 - 30 minutes</li>
<li>Centrifuge at 4000 g in bottles for 15 minutes at 4°C</li>
<li>Remove as much of the supernatant as possible and resuspended the pellet in each bottle<br>
in 500 ml of ice cold water, use graduations on side of centrifuge bottle to measure volume</li>
<li>Centrifuge at 4000 g for 15 min</li>
<li>Remove supernatant and resuspended the pellet in each bottle in 250 ml of ice cold water</li>
<li>Centrifuge at 4000 g for 15 min</li>
<li>Remove supernatant and resuspended the pellet in each bottle in 10 ml ice cold 10%<br>
glycerol</li>
<li>Combine contents of bottle into 1 50 ml Falcon tube</li>
<li>Centrifuge at 4000 g for 15 min</li>
<li>Remove supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 2 - 3 ml ice cold 10% glycerol. 18. Store in<br>
1.5 ml microfuge tubes in 50 μl aliquots, freeze in LN2, store in -80°C, cells are good for at last 6<br>
months</li>
</ol>
<h3>Transformation of Agrobacterium with vector</h3>
<ol>
<li>Thaw 50 μl electrocompetent cells of hypervirulent Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain<br>
AGL1 on ice.</li>
<li>Add 1 μl (∼100 ng) binary vector DNA to the competent cells, gently mix by flicking, and<br>
place back on ice.</li>
<li>Transfer the cells and DNA mixture on ice. Gently tap to ensure the contents are at the<br>
bottom of the cuvette. Maintain ice.</li>
<li>Electroporate using a Bio-Rad GenePulser, with the settings 2.50 kV, 25 μFD, 400 Ω,<br>
and time constant between 8.0 and 9.5 ms.</li>
<li>Immediately add 100 μl liquid LB medium to the cuvette to allow cells to recover.<br>
Transfer the cells to 500 μl LB medium in a sterile Falcon tube. Wrap the lid of the<br>
Falcon tube with Parafilm to secure.</li>
<li>Incubate the cells at room temperature, lay the Falcon tube horizontally on a shaker,<br>
and gently shake at 100 rpm for 4-6 hr.</li>
<li>Spread 20 and 40 μl of the electroporation culture, respectively, onto two plates solid LB<br>
medium supplemented with appropriate antibiotics.<br>
27</li>
<li>Incubate the plate upturned at 28°C for ∼48 hr.</li>
<li>The cells are pelleted down 3100 rpm for 10 min at 24°C and resuspended in inoculation<br>
media.</li>
</ol>
<p>** Transformation protocols depending on plant variety and explant may vary although initial<br>
steps remain constant.</p>
