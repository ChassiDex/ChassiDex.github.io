    <h1>Nicotiana tabacum</h1>
<p>Common Name : Tobacco</p>
<p>Scientific Name : Nicotiana tabacum</p>
<p>Eukaryotic Multicellular Plant</p>
<p>Biosafety level : BSL1</p>
<h2>Benefits and Applications</h2>
<p>The commercial tobacco industry is widely known for its manufacture of cigarettes, cigars,<br>
chewing tobacco, etc. Over recent years, Nicotiana tabacum has become a plant model system<br>
for tissue culture and genetic engineering.</p>
<p>Nicotiana tabacum offers unique properties of high biomass yield-high soluble protein levels<br>
compared with many other model and crop species, an attractive feature for a protein<br>
production platform.<br>
Tobacco also offers various ways of expressing proteins of interest, such as transient based<br>
expression via agrobacterium or viral induction.</p>
<p>Tobacco is neither a food nor feed crop, thus reducing the likelihood of transgenic material<br>
contaminating the food or feed chains. These features have made tobacco particularly well<br>
suited for plant-based production of biopharmaceutical products.</p>
<p>Tobacco has also been employed for the culture and fusion of plant protoplasts, providing<br>
invaluable information on ways to explore the potential of somatic hybridization in other crops.</p>
<p>Tobacco BY2 cell line has played an important role in the developments in the field of molecular<br>
farming for the expression and/or production of recombinant proteins, vaccines and antibodies<br>
are gaining significance for industrial use and human healthcare.</p>
<p>Other advantages include:</p>
<p>Faster production time from gene to protein<br>
Fast doubling time of 11-15 hrs<br>
Low capital investment<br>
Low operating costs<br>
Easily scaled operations<br>
Presence of post-translational protein modifications specific to eukaryotes, such as folding,<br>
glycosylation, or assembly of multimeric proteins<br>
Low pathogenic and endotoxic contamination<br>
High homogeneity</p>
<h2>Maintenance</h2>
<p>The Tobacco BY-2 cell line is a suspension culture derived from a callus induced from a stem of<br>
Nicotiana tabacum L. cultivar Bright Yellow 2. BY-2 cells are maintained in a modified Linsmaier<br>
and Skoog (mLS) medium (pH 5.8) in dark at 27°C in rotatory shaker(130 rpm) and subcultured<br>
at one-week intervals.</p>
<p>Agrobacterium mediated transformation of BY2 cells</p>
<p>Agrobacterium overnight culture is spun down and redissolved in 1-2 ml MS liquid medium (4.4<br>
g/l MS+salts+vitamins, 30 g/l sucrose, 0.2 mg/l 2,4 D, pH5.7 with KOH). 40 ml 3 day old BY2<br>
cell suspension culture is filtered using Whatman filter, and cells are resuspended in the same<br>
volume of MS liquid medium. 4 ml of cell suspension was mixed with 100 Âμl agrobacterium<br>
culture and transferred to the Petri dish with Whatman filter paper on the bottom. Petri dishes<br>
are sealed with parafilm and incubated for 2 to 3 days at 28ÂºC in the dark without shaking.<br>
After incubation filter papers are washed with 3×10 ml liquid MS +500 Âμg/ml Cefotaxime and<br>
transferred to selective plates containing MS agar + kanamycin or hygromycin ((4.4 g/l<br>
MS+salts+vitamins, 30 g/l sucrose, 1 mg/l 2,4 D, pH5.7 with KOH, 8 g/l agar, 50 Âμg/ml<br>
kanamycin or 20 Âμg/ml hygromycin). Washing liquid of all plates with the same transformation<br>
vector (containing suspension cells) was collected in a 50 ml tube and cells were spinned down<br>
at 500 rpm for 3 min. Pellets are resuspended in 30 ml liquid MS +500 Âμg/ml Cefotaxime,<br>
spinned down again and resuspended in 4 ml/plate. Cells are transferred to selective plates<br>
containing washed Whatman filter paper and spread out evenly over the filter paper. Plates are<br>
incubated for 6 days at 28ÂºC in the dark.</p>
<p>Growth of transformed cells on Zinc gradient. After 6 days of selection on MS+kanamycin or<br>
hygromycin plates, filter papers were cut into two and transferred to selective plates (MS agar +<br>
antibiotics) containing different concentrations (0, 50, 100, 200, 300 or 500 ÂμM) of zinc (see:<br>
table 1). Plates were incubated for two weeks at 28ÂºC in the dark.<br>
Analysis of calli Plates are analyzed using fluorescence binoculars. Additionally, cells were<br>
resuspended, put onto a microscope slide and analyzed.</p>
