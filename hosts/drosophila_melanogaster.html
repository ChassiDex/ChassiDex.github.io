    <h1>Fruit flies</h1>
<p>Common Name : Fruit Fly</p>
<p>Scientific Name : Drosophila melanogaster</p>
<p>Eukaryote Insect</p>
<p>Biosafety level : BSL1</p>
<h2>Benefits and applications as model organism</h2>
<p>Drosophila is a versatile, low maintenance and non-harming model organisms, they can be<br>
easily used in all fields of life sciences like Genetics, Biotechnology, Cancer biology, Genomics,<br>
Reproductive biology, Developmental biology, Micro chemical studies, and ecology.It has turned<br>
out as one of the best metazoan insect model organisms. It is one of the best model organisms<br>
for the biological studies ranging from molecular genetics of diseases to the ecosystems and up<br>
to the evolutionary scales.</p>
<p>Today, visible mutants, chromosome mapping, availability of complex genetic networks by<br>
multiple genome sequences (the 12 genomes project), systematic gene disruption or<br>
knock-down (RNAi stock library), microarray analysis, protein interaction maps and the FlyBase<br>
integrated database have made Drosophila a sought after model system.</p>
<p>We are able to synchronize the life cycle in captivity by seeding new embryos, feeding<br>
larvae/flies and sacrificing the adult flies at precise times. This synchronization of fly population<br>
is particularly useful for developmental studies</p>
<p>Other benefits include</p>
<ol>
<li>They are small and easily handled.</li>
<li>They can be easily anesthetized and manipulated individually with unsophisticated<br>
equipment.</li>
<li>They are sexually dimorphic (males and females are different), making it quite easy to<br>
differentiate the sexes.</li>
<li>Virgins fruit flies are physically distinctive from mature adults, making it easy to obtain virgin<br>
males and females for genetic crosses.</li>
<li>Flies have a short generation time (10-12 days) and do well at room temperature.</li>
<li>The care and culture of fruit flies requires little equipment, is low in cost and uses little space<br>
even for large cultures.</li>
</ol>
<p>In terms of developmental biology, Drosophila has been used to model development and aging,<br>
disease and homeostasis, stem cells and differentiation, neurogenesis and neuronal generation.</p>
<p>Drosophila is used in neuroscience because of its genetic tractability, complex behaviors,<br>
well-known and simple neuroanatomy, and many orthologues to human genes.</p>
<p>Drosophila share 75% of genes that cause diseases in humans and are used as a<br>
complementary model system, along with other animal models, to understand disease<br>
progression and immunology.</p>
<h2>Maintenance</h2>
<p>Drosophila are ectothermic insects whose body temperature changes with the ambient<br>
temperatures. These insects can easily survive between 12–21 degrees Celsius. Temperature<br>
impact on their viability, fertility, developmental period, foraging activity, feeding, and breeding<br>
could easily be seen in laboratory stocks and distribution and population dynamics under field<br>
conditions.The easiest way to grow flies is at room temperature. However, the optimum rearing<br>
condition is a temperature of 25°C and 60% humidity. In these conditions generation time is<br>
shorter (9-10 days from egg to adult).</p>
<p>Large containers known as fly "population cages" are used to cultivate flies in a laboratory<br>
setting . These cages consist of a cylinder made of plastic covered by a net on both sides to<br>
allow the introduction of the food inside the cage without the flies escaping.</p>
<p>Life Cycle of Drosophila<br>
Day 0: Female lays eggs<br>
Day 1: Eggs hatch<br>
Day 2: First instar (one day in length)<br>
Day 3: Second instar (one day in length)<br>
Day 5: Third and final instar (two days in length)<br>
Day 7: Larvae begin roaming stage. Pupariation (pupal formation) occurs 120 hours after egg laying<br>
Day 11-12: Eclosion (adults emerge from the pupa case).</p>
<p>Females become sexually mature 8-10 hours after eclosion</p>
<ul>
<li>The generation time of Drosophila melanogaster varies with temperature. The above cycle is<br>
for a temperature of about 22°C (72°F). Flies raised at lower temperature (to 18°C, or 64°F) will<br>
take about twice as long to develop.</li>
<li>Females can lay up to 100 eggs/day.</li>
<li>Virgin females are able to lay eggs; however they will be sterile and few in number.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seeding Embryos</p>
<p>The cycle starts with 1.5 g of collected material (a mixture composed of embryos and/or some<br>
first instar larvae) from the previous cycle. This material will be placed in a plastic container.with<br>
an active yeast mixture until the pupal phase. The container will be closed after the introduction<br>
of the biological mixture of embryos and larvae with the lid to avoid allowing the larvae to<br>
escape. It is necessary to make holes into the lid in order to allow air circulation. To avoid having<br>
larvae escape through the holes, foam plugs are used. Finally, It is recommended to wear<br>
gloves and lab coats, not only in this section but also in the whole protocol, to avoid getting dirty<br>
or staining clothes with bleach.</p>
<p>Set up the plastic container.<br>
Make three square holes with a razor blade in the plastic container lid of approximately 2.2 cm.<br>
Add tape (3/4 inch labeling tape) to the four corners of each hole to ensure a tight fit for the<br>
foam plugs (50 x 55 mm, d x l), and then place one foam plug in each hole.<br>
Cover the inside of the plastic container with plastic wrap. Over this film, add a layer of cotton to<br>
cover the bottom of the plastic container. Tear the cotton with your fingers.<br>
Prepare the fly food.<br>
Add 333 ml of deionized water in a 500 ml beaker. While stirring the beaker with a magnetic bar,<br>
add 167 μl of propionic acid and 1.08 ml of phosphoric acid, from the stock solutions (99.96%<br>
and 85%, respectively).<br>
Slowly add 77.5 g of active dry yeast, avoiding big clumps. After dissolving the dry yeast, add<br>
38.8 g of sucrose. NOTE: Sucrose should be the last ingredient to be added because<br>
immediately after adding this component, fermentation will begin.<br>
Immediately after dissolving the sucrose, pour the food over the cotton, and make sure to cover<br>
the cotton evenly. Close the plastic container with the lid to avoid escaped flies within the<br>
laboratory contaminating the food.<br>
Resuspend 1.5 g of the harvested embryos (not dechorionated) from the previous cycle with 5<br>
ml of 70% ethanol. Cut in half two filter papers and distribute the biological mixture evenly over<br>
the 4 pieces using a spatula or a transfer pipet with a wide tip (cut if necessary). Lay the filter<br>
papers on top of the soaked cotton and close the lid. Finally, incubate the plastic container at RT<br>
(24ºC) and humidity (35%) until the pupa stage. NOTE: The plastic container should not be<br>
placed in a humid chamber, otherwise this will encourage the growth of bacteria.</p>
<p>Collecting virgin females<br>
It is important to recognize the time factor involved for obtaining<br>
virgins. Females remain virgins for only 8-10 hours after enclosure and must be collected within<br>
this time frame. Females have the ability to store sperm after a single mating, so if the female<br>
for a cross is not a virgin, you will not know the genotype of the male used for your cross.</p>
<p>It is strongly suggested that you obtain extra virgins in case a mistake is made in identification<br>
or the fly dies before mating and egg laying can occur. In a strong culture, multiple virgin<br>
females should be easily obtained. Although females are able to lay eggs as virgins, they will be<br>
sterile and no larvae will be produced. Below are three ways to obtain virgins, the ‘removal<br>
method’ being most encouraged for beginners.</p>
<p>Anaesthetisation</p>
<p>The least harmful to the flies is either carbon dioxide or cooling anesthetizing. Of these two<br>
choices, cooling is the simplest, requiring only a freezer, ice and petri dishes. In addition, it is the<br>
only method which will not affect fly neurology, therefore behavior studies may begin after the<br>
flies have warmed up sufficiently.Carbon dioxide works very well, keeping flies immobile for long<br>
periods of time with no side effects, however CO2 mats (blocks) are expensive and a CO2<br>
source (usually a bottle) and delivery system (vials and clamps) are necessary, increasing the<br>
costs</p>
<p>Anaesthetising flies</p>
<p>Mutagenesis<br>
The three general techniques for mutagenesis in Drosophila are mutagenesis by irradiation,<br>
chemical mutagenesis, and genetic mutagenesis (i.e., by transposon insertion). The choice<br>
between irradiation and chemical mutagenesis is determined by the objective of the experiment.<br>
Irradiation is done by UV exposure or X-ray source while Ethyl Methanesulfonate or<br>
Ethylnitrosourea are used as effective chemical mutagens for drosophila.<br>
3-5-day-old males are mutagenised. After treatment, the males are mated immediately to<br>
harems of virgin females (usually as 20-pair bottles). These cultures should be transferred daily<br>
for 6 days. They can then be discarded or the males removed and the females further<br>
subcultured; this ensures that only post-meiotic stages are sampled and will avoid recovering<br>
clusters of identical mutations. Bottles should be labeled in such a way that identification of<br>
progeny from the same batch of parents is possible.</p>
<p>Harvesting embryos<br>
Harvesting is two days after eclosion by placing a new molasses tray. Embryos are observed as<br>
white dots.</p>
<p>Use a large paintbrush and distilled water gun to wash embryos and yeast off of molasses.<br>
Discard plates and molasses into a biohazard box.<br>
Pour solution carefully through a three sieve set (coarsest sieve 30 on top, 40 in the middle and<br>
100 on bottom). Wash clumps on top level with a distilled water gun until no clumps remain. The<br>
adult flies and 3rd instar larvae will be retained in the sieve 30.Rinse the autoclave tray with<br>
distilled water and pour the rinse water through the sieves. Remove top sieve and repeat the<br>
process if yeast clumps remain. Most of the 1st and all of the 2nd instar larvae will remain in the<br>
sieve 40.<br>
Remove the second sieve. The yellowish material in the third (bottom) sieve is the mixture of<br>
embryos and small 1st instar larvae. Use a distilled water gun to move all the eggs to one side<br>
of the sieve. Collect them with a spatula and weigh them.<br>
During these cycles the collection yield of embryos/larvae ranges between 7 and 13 g. Use only<br>
1.5 g of this material to start a new cycle (section 1). Use the rest of the embryos for further<br>
processing or can be discarded.</p>
<p>Crossing flies<br>
Once females are deemed virgins, add males. When setting up crosses, a 3:1<br>
ratio of virgin females to males is ideal. Generally, males will mate more efficiently if they have<br>
matured 3 days or longer. Be sure to select robust, healthy males; the older the flies, the lower<br>
the mating efficiency. Mating occurs quickly and the behavior is interesting to watch, but will not<br>
be addressed here. Females begin laying fertile eggs soon after mating. Refer to the life cycle<br>
chart for evidence of F1 larvae. Remove adults once it has been established that enough larvae<br>
are present (typically 7-8 days after the cross) since you may not be able to distinguish parents<br>
from the F1 generation.</p>
<p>Euthanizing<br>
This is an unfortunate necessity when using flies. A bottle or beaker with soapy water, or<br>
mineral oil is generally used. Dump anesthetized flies directly into the soapy water or mineral oil<br>
where they drown. A bottle (beaker, or screw-capped jar) filled with ethanol or isopropanol can<br>
also be used as a morgue.</p>
<p>Maintaining Stocks<br>
Most large fly laboratories maintain stocks that are not in everyday use at 18oC on a 4-5-week<br>
generation cycle. Stocks should be kept as two to four independent cultures, and it may be<br>
convenient to keep these on alternating generations, 2 weeks apart. Stocks are normally<br>
maintained in vials.<br>
Most stocks can be kept by dump-transfer of flies to fresh vials. However, it is important to avoid<br>
overcrowded cultures, and only 20 or so flies should be transferred. It is good practice to inspect<br>
the flies on transfer, to ensure that both sexes are present and that their phenotype is as<br>
expected.</p>
<p>Freezing embryos<br>
The embryos not utilized for continuation of the population can be used immediately for<br>
experiments or alternatively can be frozen at -80 ºC. For both options, the embryos may need to<br>
first be dechorionated.<br>
For dechorionation, wash the embryos for 2 min in 50% bleach solution and rinse thoroughly<br>
with distilled water.<br>
To freeze the embryos, first dry by pressing firmly with a paper towel, and then weigh and place<br>
them, with the help of a spatula, into a 15 or 50 ml conical tube. Finally submerge the conical<br>
tube in liquid N2 for a few seconds.</p>
