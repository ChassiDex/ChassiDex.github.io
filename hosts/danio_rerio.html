    <h1>Zebrafish</h1>
<p>Common Name: Zebrafish</p>
<p>Scientific Name: Danio rerio</p>
<p>Domain: Eukaryotic</p>
<p>Biosafety Level: BSL1/BSL2, Varies depending on research context</p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>Zebrafish, a small and robust organism, presents numerous advantages as a model organism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small size (2.5-4 cm long) and robust organism</li>
<li>In its larval stages it is transparent and as it matures to an adult it develops stripes that<br>
run along the length of the body and look blue in color. Transparency provides optical<br>
clarity, in vivo study of molecular mechanisms by allowing for live imaging.</li>
<li>Cheaper to maintain than mice.</li>
<li>External fertilization, fast growth rate and production of multiple offsprings which allows<br>
study over multiple generations.</li>
<li>Zebrafish have similar genetic structure to humans and share 70% of the genes. In<br>
addition to genomic similarity, the presence of conserved organs and organ systems<br>
between human and zebrafish contributes to development of a number of successful<br>
models of human diseases.</li>
<li>Ability to create gene knockouts using CRISPR/Cas9 and TALEN techniques.</li>
<li>Ability to create tissue specific transgenic animals. Recent improvement of the<br>
Tol2-based transgenic system in zebrafish has allowed the control of gene expression in<br>
a spatiotemporal manner by coupling with regulatory elements such as GAL4/UAS or<br>
Cre/LoxP.</li>
<li>Fully sequenced genome. Its genome is 1,505,581,940 base pairs in length and contains<br>
26,247 protein-coding genes.  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>Zebrafish serve as a model for various research areas such as development, genetics, immunity, behavior, physiology, and nutrition research:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developmental biology research - Zebrafish is a key model organism for the study of<br>
vertebrate developmental biology. Cell division, migration, differentiation and cell fate,<br>
neurological development,etc is studied using zebrafish models. The strengths of this<br>
model system lie in its external, visually accessible development, ease of experimental<br>
manipulation, and common genetic underpinnings with other vertebrates including<br>
humans.</li>
<li>Human disease modeling - Zebrafish is used as a successful model for metabolic<br>
diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, human melanoma, acute lymphoblastic<br>
leukemia, polycystic kidney disease, nephronophthisis, acute kidney injury, Parkinson’s<br>
disease, Huntington’s disease, Alzheimer disease, myocardial infarction.</li>
<li>Cancer Research -Another cell transplant technique applied to zebrafish is<br>
xenotransplantation of tumor cells into embryonic or juvenile fish. Mammalian tumor cells<br>
can survive, divide, metastasize, and induce angiogenesis in the zebrafish embryo<br>
before the immune system develops or in immunosuppressed juvenile fish. This<br>
technique can be combined with transgenic cell labeling to visualize the interaction of<br>
tumor cells with their microenvironment in vivo. In addition, mutagenic or chemical<br>
screens can be devised to identify genes or chemicals that modify tumor metastasis or<br>
angiogenesis</li>
<li>Testing Chemical Compounds in Zebrafish Embryos - The zebrafish embryo represents<br>
a convenient model for studying interactions between chemical compounds and animal<br>
physiology. The value of the zebrafish model is derived from its small size, chemical<br>
permeability, ease of observation, and physiologic similarity to other vertebrates<br>
including humans. The small size of zebrafish embryos allows them to be arrayed in 96-<br>
or 384-well plates. Chemical compounds can then be added to the wells and<br>
experimental endpoints measured after the desired incubation period. This process can<br>
be mechanized so that large libraries of compounds can be screened efficiently. The<br>
aqueous environment of zebrafish is advantageous, because chemical compounds can<br>
be directly added to the fish's water and freely diffuse into the developing embryo</li>
<li>Random mutagenesis strategies in zebrafish have generated thousands of distinct<br>
mutant phenotypes, many of which are consistent with human genetic disorders.Along<br>
with study of these diseases, rescue by gene therapy and other pharmacology agents to<br>
alleviate symptoms are screened and tested.  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Maintenance</h2>
<ul>
<li>Zebrafish is an ectothermic, tropical species native to South Asia. Facilities utilizing<br>
zebrafish as a model should filter municipal water with sediment and carbon pre-filters,<br>
reverse osmosis, and deionization to create high-quality base water. Adding small<br>
amounts of high-quality sea salts produces "fish-ready" culture water. Monitoring and<br>
maintaining daily temperature, pH, and conductivity within ranges of 26–29°C, 7–8, and<br>
200–3000 micro-Siemens respectively is essential. Weekly measurements and<br>
maintenance should include alkalinity, hardness, carbon dioxide, and dissolved oxygen,<br>
aiming for 50–75 ppm, 100–200 ppm, 0–15 ppm, and 6–8 ppm respectively. Nitrogenous<br>
waste, harmful even at low concentrations, necessitates weekly monitoring of ammonia,<br>
nitrite, and nitrate. Ammonia and nitrite levels should be as close to zero ppm as<br>
possible, while nitrate levels below 50 ppm are acceptable. Biological filters employ<br>
ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria to transform toxic<br>
ammonia into less harmful nitrate, with nitrate reduced via routine water exchanges.<br>
Before making adjustments, cross-verification of water quality parameters using two<br>
methods is advised. Adjustments should be gradual to mitigate stress on research fish<br>
and biological filters. These conditions help maintain environment similar to natural<br>
habitat of zebrafish while providing ideal conditions for research.</li>
<li>Zebrafish exhibit a well-documented tolerance for a wide temperature range, with lower<br>
and higher temperatures posing no conflict with animal welfare standards. Lower<br>
temperatures lead to slower embryo/larvae growth, while adults show no known<br>
behavioral differences within the proposed temperature range.Temperature influences<br>
both water chemistry and animal physiology. Oxygen solubility in water decreases as<br>
temperature rises, but recirculating systems negate the need for additional oxygenation<br>
due to constant water movement. For consistency and standardized husbandry, housing<br>
water temperature typically ranges from 24°C to 29°C. Emphasizing the avoidance of<br>
sudden temperature changes is crucial.Developmental stages are often referenced in<br>
hours post-fertilization (hpf) based on a temperature of 28.5°C.</li>
<li>Modern laboratory conditions often provide zebrafish with a static dark-light (D-L) cycle,<br>
usually 10 hours of darkness and 14 hours of light. Gradual changes in light intensity<br>
mimicking dawn and dusk can be included optionally. Although different settings, such as<br>
a 12:12 D-L cycle, don't directly impact animal welfare, they may influence physiological<br>
processes like spawning frequency and breeding success.</li>
<li>A combination of live and processed dry feeds generally enhances growth, generation<br>
time, and reproductive performance, indicative of well-being. Dry feed diets are<br>
considered nutritionally complete, while live feeds and associated fish prey-capture<br>
behavior offer enrichment. Feeding frequency should align with fish developmental<br>
stages. Larvae, which grow rapidly, benefit from two to three daily feedings of live feed if<br>
possible. Feeding can be manual or automated. Automated feeding robots can dispense<br>
both dry and live feeds in defined quantities, though adjusting for varying animal counts<br>
requires precise programming. When using automation, daily visual inspections of fish<br>
tanks by staff remain vital.</li>
<li>Females can lay hundreds of eggs per mating, but allowing at least a week's recovery<br>
between spawnings is recommended for sufficient regeneration and maturation of new<br>
ova. Adults not designated for embryo production should be kept in mixed-sex groups to<br>
facilitate natural breeding behavior and prevent egg-associated oviduct inflammation<br>
("egg-bound" females). Managing fish colony genetics is crucial to minimize inbreeding's<br>
negative effects and prevent loss of genetic diversity over time. Due to space and cost<br>
constraints, distinct fish strains and lines are often kept in smaller groups. To counter<br>
inbreeding depression, each new generation should result from an outcross, with sibling<br>
matings reserved for necessary situations.</li>
<li>Rearing embryos and larvae holds significance in zebrafish facilities. Embryos are<br>
maintained in embryo medium, often containing 0.5 mg/l methylene blue to combat<br>
fungal infections. Stocking densities of up to 100 embryos per 35 ml are used in 9 cm<br>
diameter Petri dishes under a 28.5 ± 0.5℃ D-L cycle. Employing sterilized water is<br>
essential, with removal of extraneous materials like feces, scales, and unfertilized eggs<br>
necessary prior to transferring the eggs. Regular medium changes and removal of<br>
non-viable embryos, dead eggs, and chorion remains are advised.</li>
<li>A clean environment is fundamental for upholding high animal health and welfare<br>
standards. To achieve this, careful consideration must be given to prevent<br>
cross-contamination during routine husbandry procedures. Equipment in contact with<br>
fish, such as nets and mating boxes, should be dedicated to specific systems and periodically sanitized. While chemical sanitization is viable, rinsing adequately to prevent<br>
water contamination is crucial. A simpler and safer cleaning method involves heating to<br>
at least 60℃ for a minimum of one hour. Isolating equipment used for quarantine from<br>
main facility equipment is essential.</li>
