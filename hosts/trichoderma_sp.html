    <h1>Trichoderma</h1>
<p>Scientific Name: Trichoderma Sp(Trichoderma reesei, Trichoderma virens)</p>
<p>Domain : Prokaryotic</p>
<p>GRAS Organism used for industrial application</p>
<p>Biosafety Level: BSL1/BSL2, Varies depending on research context</p>
<h2>Benefits and Applications</h2>
<ul>
<li>There are around 90 species under the Trichoderma genus. Out of which, few species<br>
stand out for industrial applications.  </li>
<li>Members of the genus Trichoderma are also utilized in various industry branches –<br>
mainly in the production of enzymes, antibiotics, and other metabolites.  </li>
<li>Several Trichoderma spp. positively affect plants by stimulating plant growth, and<br>
protecting plants from fungal and bacterial pathogens. They are used in biological plant<br>
protection as fungicides as well as in bioremediation.  </li>
<li>Trichoderma reesei (Teleomorph Hypocrea jecorina) is one of the two major fungal<br>
platforms for industrial enzyme production, along with Aspergillus sp.  </li>
<li>Its use derives from its history as a model organism for studies on cellulose degradation<br>
and its cellulase enzyme complex since the 1940s, which suggested its use for industrial<br>
bioethanol manufacturing during the oil crisis in the mid 1970s. T. reesei has now<br>
maintained its position as a highly productive, easy-to-handle, robust and safe cell<br>
factory for more than 40 years.  </li>
<li>In addition to T. reese's role in bio-ethanol production, it is used to produce industrial<br>
enzymes with a broad range of applications supporting the bio-based economy. To date there are<br>
around 243 commercially available enzyme products manufactured by fermentation of<br>
microorganisms, 30 of these are made using Trichoderma as a host, 21 of which are<br>
recombinant products sold for use in food, feed, and technical applications including<br>
textiles and pulp and paper.  </li>
<li>T. Reesei is used for the industrial production of Cellulases and has been classified as a<br>
GRAS organism by FDA.The enzymes (cellobiohydrolase, beta-glucosidase and<br>
endo-glucanase) expressed by the production strain belong to the cellulase class of<br>
enzymes.</li>
<li>Cellulases catalyze the hydrolysis of the 1,4-beta-D-glycosidic linkages in cellulose,<br>
hemicellulose, lichens and cereal beta-D-glucans to break down the cellulose present in<br>
plants.  </li>
<li>Cellulase enzymes are used as processing aids in a wide range of food products. The<br>
typical food applications where this cellulase will be used are:<br>
Fruit and vegetable processing, starch and grain processing, brewing and other cereal<br>
based beverages and potable/ fuel alcohol production. Brewing and Other Cereal Based<br>
Beverages.  </li>
<li>Brewing processes rely on cereals (malted or not) as the primary raw material. And, are<br>
the primary raw material in the production of beer and other cereal based beverages.<br>
Cellulase enzymes are typically added during the mashing step to reduce the viscosity of<br>
the wort and improve the separation of the wort from the spent grains.  </li>
<li>Also, the cellulase enzyme degrades the polymeric beta-glucans present in the<br>
endosperm cell wall of grain, into smaller less viscous molecules, thereby lessening the<br>
filtration time and Wine Processing: Cellulases are added during maceration, vinification<br>
(storage, aging) and/or before filtration. They catalyze the degradation of structural<br>
polysaccharides thereby, lowering the viscosity which results in improved juice yield,<br>
clarification and filterability.  </li>
<li>Cellulases also liberate and solubilize the phenolic compounds (tannins) and glycoside<br>
precursors from grape cells wall and flesh leading to better color intensity, stability and<br>
improved overall mouth feel and aroma. The enzymes may be inactivated by<br>
pasteurization or removed by bentonite addition and/or filtration. Therefore, the enzymes<br>
will not be present/active in the final food.  </li>
<li>Fruit and Vegetable Processing: In the juice industry, cellulases are applied in<br>
combination with other macerating enzymes. They are used to increase process<br>
performance and yield, improve extraction methods and clarify and stabilize juice.<br>
They can also reduce viscosity in nectars and purees. Here the enzymes are denatured<br>
during the pasteurization steps included in the processing, rendering the enzyme<br>
inactive.  </li>
<li><p>Starch/Grain processing:</p>
<p>Complex structures in cereals can cause processing issues when the grain is milled and<br>
  when fractionated into starch, gluten and fiber.<br>
The use of cellulases during grain milling can provide a smooth and efficient processing<br>
of that grain, enable separation of the grain structures and ensure quality polysaccharide<br>
and gluten fractions.<br>
Cellulases are typically added in grain processing during the milling, mixing and steeping<br>
processes.<br>
Enzymes are inactivated when used in further food processing, such as baking and<br>
starch liquefaction, and are considered non-functional.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Trichoderma fungi use various complex direct or indirect mechanisms against fungal<br>
pathogens, which usually interact altogether in the biocontrol phenomenon.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The direct impact on pathogens includes the production of cell wall degrading enzymes<br>
(CWDEs), synthesis of antibiotics, competition for space and nutrients (mainly carbon,<br>
nitrogen, and iron), and establishment of a direct parasitic relationship with the fungal<br>
pathogen.</p>
</li>
<li>On the other hand, Trichoderma indirectly induces local or systemic plant resistance<br>
through products (elicitors) released from the cell walls of the plant host (endo elicitors)<br>
and the infecting microorganism (exo elicitors). The type of mechanisms involved is often<br>
a strain characteristic and depends on the interaction type between the antagonist<br>
microorganism, pathogen, and the host plant.Trichoderma seems to be the best<br>
candidate for use in green technologies due to its wide biofertilization and biostimulatory<br>
potential. Most of the species from the genus Trichoderma belong to the plant<br>
growth-promoting fungi that produce phytohormones and the<br>
1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase enzyme. The biocontrol and<br>
biostimulation properties of Trichoderma directly translate into its wide application in<br>
agriculture.  </li>
<li>Due to the largest number of isolated anti-fungal bioactive compounds, Currently, at<br>
least 77 commercial Trichoderma-based bio-fungicides are available on the global<br>
market, including 7 approved by the European Commission for use in the Member<br>
States of the European Union.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Maintenance</h2>
<p>PDA (potato dextrose agar) is used for the revival and maintenance of Trichoderma</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fresh cultures preservation:</p>
<p>Single spores technique is used for Trichoderma viride to get a pure culture, from the<br>
mother culture a plug of media is taken and placed on fresh media.<br>
The plates are properly wrapped and incubated at 25 °C for 7 days and this is repeated<br>
after 7-10 days to maintain the culture for a longer period of time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Slants preservation:</p>
<p>Autoclave PDA media at 121 °C for 15 min at 15psi. Pour autoclaved media in already<br>
sterilized test tubes/vials. Allow media to solidify in test tubes/vials at an angle of 65°.<br>
Loopful inoculums of Trichoderma viride are transferred to Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA)<br>
slants, keep the tubes in incubators at 25 °C for 7 days and maintain at 4 °C as pure<br>
culture.<br>
Recovery inoculums are placed on fresh PDA media and incubated for 7 days. They are<br>
then checked for the recovery and viability within a three month interval.</p>
</li>
<li>Gene Manipulation:<br>
  There are two potent methods of Trichoderma transformation mediated by either (a)<br>
polyethylene glycol or (b) Agrobacterium. Method used and protocol differs based on<br>
applications.  </li>
