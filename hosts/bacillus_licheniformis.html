    <h1>Bacillus licheniformis</h1>
<p>Scientific Name: Bacillus licheniformis</p>
<p>Domain: Prokaryotic</p>
<p>GRAS Organism used for industrial application</p>
<p>Biosafety Level: BSL1/BSL2, Varies depending on research context</p>
<p>Gram positive bacteria</p>
<h2>Benefits and Applications</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The genome of Bacillus licheniformis DSM13 is very well studied consisting of a single<br>
chromosome that has a size of 4,222,748 base pairs. The average G+C ratio is 46.2%.<br>
4,286 open reading frames, 72 tRNA genes, 7 rRNA operons and 20 transposase genes<br>
were identified. The genome contains defined inserted regions that can be identified at<br>
the sequence as well as at the functional level. B. licheniformis DSM13 has a<br>
well-conserved secretory system, no polyketide biosynthesis, but is able to form the<br>
lipopeptide lichenysin. From the further analysis of the genome sequence, we identified<br>
conserved regulatory DNA motives, the occurrence of the glyoxylate bypass and the<br>
presence of anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase explaining that B. licheniformis is able to<br>
grow on acetate and 2,3-butanediol as well as anaerobically on glucose. This makes<br>
Bacillus licheniformis a key organism in industrial biotech for easy maintenance and<br>
genetic manipulation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bacillus licheniformis is a Gram positive spore-forming bacterial species of high<br>
biotechnological interest with numerous present and potential uses, including the<br>
production of bioactive compounds that are applied in a wide range of fields, such as<br>
aquaculture, agriculture, food, biomedicine, and pharmaceutical industries.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cellulase enzymes are applied in juice extraction processes, pulp and paper, textile<br>
industry, secondary metabolites, animal feed, extraction of vegetable dyes and in<br>
obtaining fermentable sugars used in the production of biofuels, and the demand for this<br>
enzyme is exponentially increasing</p>
</li>
<li><p>Its use as an expression vector for the production of enzymes and other bioproducts is<br>
also gaining interest due to the availability of novel genetic manipulation tools with<br>
applications in bioflocculation, biomineralization, biofuel production, bioremediation, and<br>
anti-biofilm activity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>B. licheniformis is used as a probiotic in animal feed, where isolates have been shown to<br>
prevent disease and promote growth.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It also has agricultural applications by preventing and controlling certain plant diseases,<br>
soil improvement, and fertilizer efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>Two main products directly associated with B. licheniformis are -<ul>
<li>Bacitracin -<br>
A mixture of peptides produced by Bacillus licheniformis. Bacitracin A is the<br>
major constituent of commercial preparations. It has been widely used as a<br>
growth promoter in animals, but has been banned for that purpose in the<br>
European Union.<br>
It is highly active against many Gram-positive bacteria and is mainly used as a<br>
component of topical preparations.</li>
<li>Lichenysin -<br>
Lichenysin is a surfactin-like LP produced by Bacillus licheniformis. The molecule<br>
exhibits structural and functional similarities with the surfactin class of LPs.<br>
Stability over a wide pH range, temperature, and salt concentration. Hence B.<br>
licheniformis is used in laundry detergent formulations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Maintenance</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Bacterial isolates are also cultured in MBS medium (30 °C, 500 rpm, for up to five days)<br>
to evaluate their ability to form spores. Fresh mounts are immobilized on agar pads (3%<br>
aqueous agar solution) and prepared using an aliquot of the culture.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The strain is preserved in the form of spores impregnated in paper discs. Initially, the<br>
microorganism is grown in MBS broth sporulation medium (composition, in g/L: meat<br>
peptone 10.0; yeast extract 1.0; KH2PO4 1.0; MgSO4.7H2O 0.1; CaCl2.2H2O 0.1 ;<br>
FeSO4.7H2O 0.01; MnSO4.H2O 0.01; ZnSO4.7H2O 0.01), pH 7.2, in a shaker at 200<br>
rpm, 30 °C for 5 days.</p>
</li>
<li>A volume of 30 mL of the culture is centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 20 minutes and the<br>
supernatant is discarded. Then, the sample is resuspended in 3 mL of a saline solution<br>
(NaCl 0.85% w/v), incubated at 80 °C for 12 minutes, and subsequently immersed in an<br>
ice bath for 5 minutes. For spore quantification, serial decimal dilutions of the cell<br>
suspension in a saline solution (NaCl 0.85% w/v) are made, and a 100-μL aliquot is<br>
evenly distributed over Petri dishes containing nutrient agar medium using a spreader.</li>
<li>Plates are incubated for 48 hours at 30 °C until bacterial colonies are visually observed,<br>
and the results are expressed in spores mL−1.</li>
<li><p>Blotting paper weighing 250 g m−2 and a 7.0 mm hole punch are used to prepare the<br>
discs. Twenty discs are distributed per Petri dish (90 × 15 mm), which are individually<br>
packed, autoclaved at 121 °C in three 1-hour cycles with 24-hour intervals, and then<br>
oven-dried at 60 °C.</p>
</li>
<li><p>After the sterilization and drying process, discs are impregnated with 20 μL aliquots of<br>
the cell suspension (5.8 × 10^9 spores mL−1), dried in an oven at 35 °C for 24 hours,<br>
and stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C.</p>
</li>
<li>The optimal conditions are determined to be a cultivation temperature of 50-60°C with 12<br>
hours of cultivation time at an agitation speed of 100 rpm and an inoculum size of 1.7 ×<br>
10^9 cells/ml. Enzyme production is maximum between 45-50°C.</li>
