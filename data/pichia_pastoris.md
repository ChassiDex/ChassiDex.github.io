# About
Protein expression in the microbial eukaryotic host Pichia pastoris offers the possibility to generate high amounts of recombinant protein in a fast and easy to use expression system. As a single-celled microorganism P. pastoris is easy to manipulate and grows rapidly on inexpensive media at high cell densities. Being a eukaryote, P. pastoris is able to perform many of the post-translational modifications performed by higher eukaryotic cells and the obtained recombinant proteins undergo protein folding, proteolytic processing, disulfide bond formation and glycosylation Another important advantage is the secretion of the recombinant protein into the growth medium, using a signal sequence to target the foreign protein to the secretory pathway of P. pastoris.

# Growth Characteristics
Wild-type P. pastoris is able to grow on many different carbon and energy sources (Inan and Meagher, 2001), of which glycerol, glucose and methanol are the most commonly used in manufacturing processes. The choice of carbon-substrate and, therefore, the feasible operational range with respect to specific growth rate (μ) and optimum productivity (qp) is dependent on the chosen promoter.
