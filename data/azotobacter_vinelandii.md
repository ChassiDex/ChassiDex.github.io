# Growth Characteristics
A. vinelandii can be cultured in Burk’s medium (B medium: 0.2% KH2PO4, 0.8% K2HPO4, 20% sucrose, 0.2% MgSO4·7H2O, 0.09% CaCl2·2H2O, 0.005% FeSO4·7H2O, 0.1 nM Na2MoO4·2H2O and 1.6% agar) or with the addition of 13 mM NH4OAc (BN medium) at 30°C at 300 rpm.

# Transformation Protocols
1. Transformation of A. vinelandii was performed with a protocol from Dr. Dennis R. Dean (personal communication) with modifications. Briefly, A. vinelandii cells were streaked onto BN-Mo plates (0.2% KH2PO4, 0.8% K2HPO4, 20% sucrose, 0.2% MgSO4·7H2O, 0.09% CaCl2·2H2O, 0.005% FeSO4·7H2O, 13 mM NH4OAc and 1.6% agar) and were grown for 2 days in a 30°C incubator. A loop of cells was added to a 125-ml sterile flask containing the medium composed of 0.2% KH2PO4, 0.8% KH2PO4, 20% sucrose, 0.2% MgSO4·7H2O, 0.09% CaCl2·2H2O and 65 µl of 5 M NH4OAc. The flask was set on a bench for 5 min, followed by vortexing for 10 s. The culture was then grown for 18–20 h at 30°C and 170 rpm. Resultant competent cells (200 µl) were mixed with 200 µl of 1× MOPS transformation buffer (20 mM MOPS and 20 mM MgSO4·7H2O) and 5 µl plasmid DNA. The mixture (300 µl) was incubated at room temperature for 15–20 min, and 2.7 ml of B medium was then added into the mixture. The mixture containing the cells was shaken overnight and then spread on a B medium plate with 1.6% agar and appropriate antibiotics.:
