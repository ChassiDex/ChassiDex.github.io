# Growth Characteristics
AMB-1 demonstrates optimal growth in microaerophillic conditions. However, devices designed to precisely limit oxygen content of the plate are expensive and not easily accessible to most iGEM teams. The above figure displays effective, low cost techniques to plate AMB-1 microaerophillically that are more effective than published methods

# Transformation Protocols
1. AMB-1 must be grown aerobically prior to transformation to prevent magnetosome formation. Magnetosomes will cause cells to die during electroporation. Simply innoculate 500 uL cells in 5 mL of E-MSGM supplemented with 50 uL of iron malleate and 50 Ul of vitamin solution in culture tube on shaker at 30oC. in 48 hours, Cells will be concentrated enough for transformation.:
