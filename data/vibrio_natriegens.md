# About
**prokaryotic** **facultative-anaerobic** **gram-negative**

# Applications
1. Can be used for cloning thanks to its fast doubling time
2. Reaches high cell densities and good for protein expression

# Strains
1. Vibrio natriegens ( ATCC14048): a non pathogenic strain

# Life Cycle
Vibrio natriegens has a doubling time of under 10 min in optimal conditions ( between 35 and 37Â°C) It is a marine organism, so it is important to add additional salt to the media for an final concentration of 2.5%.
