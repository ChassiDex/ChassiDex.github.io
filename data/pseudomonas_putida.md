# About

Pseudomonas putida is a rod-shaped, flagellated, gram-negative bacterium that is found in most soil and water habitats where there is oxygen. It grows optimally at 25-30 C and can be easily isolated. Due to the bacteria’s strong appetite for organic pollutants, researchers are attracted to using Pseudomonas putida as the “laboratory ‘workhorse’ for research on bacteria-remediated soil processes.This bacteria is unique because it has the most genes involved in breaking down aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbons which are hazardous chemicals caused by burning fuel, coal, tobacco, and other organic matter.

# Growth Characteristics

* Optimal Temperature: 30 degrees Celsius
* Atmosphere: Aerobic
* Doubling time: Apprx. 41 minutes when grown in a rotary shaker at 150 rpm,
* Shaking at lower rpms (50) produces filaments
* Can be grown on M9 minimal medium, ATCC medium 1065, and LB agar.
